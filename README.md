# bank-web-scraper
 For my portfolio project, I will be working on a web scraper. A web scraper is a data scraper that extracts select data from websites. This process can be manually done by software or automated by a bot. This process is typically done by parsing, searching, and reformatting a site in order to receive the requested information. For example, a web scraper could extract all last names from a site and copy them to the local machine. Once the data is taken from the websites, the program then stores this data into some type of local database or spreadsheet. I will be applying this methodology to a web scraper that will extract data from local banks. Some of these banks include Byline Bank, Busey Bank, Naperville Wintrust, and Republic Bank of Chicago. Using banking data websites online, I will scrape for CD, interest, and money market rates. To complete this task, I researched numerous different libraries that would be able to work with C++ to effectively scrape data. I will use gumbo to parse HTML, and cpr to pull HTML requests.
